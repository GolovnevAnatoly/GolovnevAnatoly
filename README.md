My name is Anatoly. I am a physicist, PhD. Apart from theoretical physics, I sometimes play with programming. Currently, it is frontend. Fullstack is around the corner. I am also familiar with Java. A special mention goes to C++, which I have already somewhat forgotten, but it will always stay among my favorite languages.
