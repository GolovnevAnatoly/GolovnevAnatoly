My name is Anatoly. I am a physicist, Ph.D. Lately I've been drifting away from theoretical physics to programming with emphasis on the frontend. Fullstack is around the corner. I am also familiar with Java. A special mention goes to C++, which I have already somewhat forgotten, but it will always stay among my favorite languages.
